The intent of this project is to allow users to upload and retarget images on their web browser using seam carving.
Seam-carving is a method of content-aware image scaling that preserves the proportions of objects. For more information on seam carving, see the following two links:

Currently, this project is postponed due to Javascript bugs that I haven't been able to fix yet. I've implemented a basic version of this program in C++ without any GUI, but it
only works with .ppm files, which have a very simple format for reading RGB pixel values. I plan on coming back to this project when my knowledge and skills are such that
finishing the project will be less time-intensive.
